              <Paragraph>
              Sustainability can be described as the capability to provide for economic aspects, which makes a person independent when it comes to support from others. This bare necessity of life empowers people and populations to make choices that would bring about the actualization of sustainable development, improved quality, and affluence.
              </Paragraph>
